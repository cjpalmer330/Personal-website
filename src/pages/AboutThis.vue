        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-sans text-blue-200 font-bold grid-start-2 row-span-4 text-center">&emsp;&emsp;When my   Thanksgiving  break week started, I was given freedom   to choose how I spend my next 11 days, whether to be  productive or not. I knew that although I have done  some work with JS,HTML, and CSS before, my skills  weren't where theyneeded to be to obtain an  internship the upcomingsummer. So I decided that I   would spend mythanksgiving trying out the   React-Tailwind techstack. I wasn't planning on  building a portfoliowebsite, I just new I needed to  actually try makingsomething cohesive in order to  truly understand theinterplay between components. As   such I dove head first into tail wind, going through  the documentation and old StackOverflow posts from 7,  8 years ago everytime I came across an obstacle. I  proved to myself in a very short amount of time,that   I am able to take steps towards learning a  newtechnology, and do so under my own direction.</h2>
